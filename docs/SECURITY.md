## 🚨 Reporting a Security Issue
If you discover any **security vulnerabilities**, please **do NOT** report them publicly. Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Email us** at **security@devsamaj.com** with details of the issue.
2. **Provide a detailed report**, including:
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Potential impact and severity.
   - Any suggestions for a fix (if possible).
3. **Expect a response within 48 hours**.
4. Once the issue is fixed, we will publicly disclose it responsibly.

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices
- Never expose API keys or sensitive credentials in public repositories.
- Use **strong authentication** (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
- Follow **secure coding standards** to prevent vulnerabilities.

By following these guidelines, we ensure a **safe and secure open-source environment** for all contributors. 🚀
